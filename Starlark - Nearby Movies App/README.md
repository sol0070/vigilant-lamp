App written in Starlark - used for pxiel based displays. Starlark is a 'dialect' of python
# Nearby Movies
This app takes a zipcode and a radius from the user. 

Two different API's are used from Flixter. 

One returns a randomly selected theater and the other returns a randomly selected movie from that theater. 

The JSON response is parsed, and the app shows the poster image on the left and the details of the movie on the right: Title, motion picture rating, duration, and tomatometer percentage rating

An animation will then slide the reveal more information to the left of the poster image. 

The theater that the movie is playing at and the distance away that theater is in miles

#TODO
Add show times for the day once API publishes this data
